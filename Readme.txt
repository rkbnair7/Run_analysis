You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

The script merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. Then it extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
The script uUses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Then it creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
